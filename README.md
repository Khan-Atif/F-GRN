# F-GRN
Fuzzy Gene Regulatory Networks


F-GRN implements fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm to identify functionally related genes (gene-sets). F-GRN is developed in Matlab as an installable package. F-GRN allows user to identify gene signatures in human monocyte derived dendritic cell responsive to influenza infection. This interactive package is developed by the team of researchers at Thakar Lab located at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.
