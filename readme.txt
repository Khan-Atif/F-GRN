Fuzzy Gene Regulatory Networks (F-GRN)

F-GRN implements fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm to identify functionally related genes (gene-sets). F-GRN is developed in Matlab as an installable package. F-GRN allows user to identify gene signatures in human monocyte derived dendritic cell responsive to influenza infection. This interactive package is developed by the team of researchers at Thakar Lab located at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York. 



Prerequisites for running F-GRN: 

1. If you have Maltab installed: 

   Verify the MATLAB Runtime is installed and ensure you    
   have installed version 9.0.1 (R2016a).   

   If the MATLAB Runtime is not installed, do the following:
   (a) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MATLAB Runtime installer.

   (b) run the MATLAB Runtime installer.

2.  If you do not have Matlab: 

    Download the Windows 64-bit version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2016a 
    from the MathWorks Web site by navigating to:

    http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
   
    For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see 
    Package and Distribute in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
    in the MathWorks Documentation Center.    


    NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run MCRInstaller. 


    Files required to run F-GRN package:

    ================================
    -F_GRN.exe
    -MCRInstaller.exe  (to be downlaoded from internet).
